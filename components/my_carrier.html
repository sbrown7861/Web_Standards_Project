<h2>My Carrier</h2>

<p>My Carrier is a travel planner. I really like their log in the overall look is very clean and professional. This style of page has plenty of negative space and uses darker colors to attract attention to aspects of interest. As a client having a page
    like this probably turns into having a lot of users. The page has a natural flow to it and this makes it easy to use. As users we like easy to use.</p>
