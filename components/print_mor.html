<h2>Print Mor</h2>

<p>Print Mor is a graphic design company that has a very cool website. I really like their nav bar and how the graphic from the background
    flows into that actual nav bar giving the overall page a feel of continuity. As a client these sorts of graphics and flow are a good indicator to the possible customer of what you as a graphic design firm could do for them. As a user seeing this is kind of a sales pitch and a good one at that.</p>
